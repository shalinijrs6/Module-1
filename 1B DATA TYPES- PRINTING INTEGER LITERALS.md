# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types – Printing Integer Literals

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the following integer literals: 123, 456, 789.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Initialize the integer literals `123`, `456`, and `789`.  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the numbers `123`, `456`, and `789`.  
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
## Reg.No-212223060009

## Name- ADHAVAN K
```
num1 = 123
num2 = 456
num3 = 789

print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num3)

```
